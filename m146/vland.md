The main reason to use a VLAN is to mitigate all the broadcast messages, which could consist of:
Also a reason is, that it is very scalable, since you don't need new equipment.

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) Requests:

Devices use ARP to discover the MAC address associated with a given IP address. ARP requests are broadcast messages.
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) Requests:

When a device joins a network and needs an IP address, it sends out a DHCP request, which is typically broadcast to the entire local network.
NetBIOS Name Service:

NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System) uses broadcast messages to resolve NetBIOS names to IP addresses.
Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP):

Used by network devices to advertise their identity and capabilities to neighboring devices. LLDP messages are typically broadcast.
IPv6 Neighbor Discovery:

Similar to ARP in IPv4, Neighbor Discovery in IPv6 uses broadcast-like messages to resolve IP addresses to link-layer addresses.
Router Advertisements:

In IPv6, routers periodically send router advertisements to announce their presence and provide network configuration information. These messages can be broadcast.
Layer 2 (Switch) Broadcasts:

Various Layer 2 protocols use broadcast messages for tasks like spanning tree protocol (STP) to prevent loops in the network.

Used to send traffic from one network to another.
To identify, from which vlan traffic was sent from, we need to use something called a tag.
802.1Q (Dot-1Q) Tag will be added to the data package when going from one switch to another.
